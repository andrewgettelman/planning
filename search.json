    "text": "May 12-18 2025\nAt various sites – Beijing, Boulder, Oxford, Sao Paulo, Stockholm, Tokyo – around the world\nThe Global Hackathon will bring together scientists around the world to begin exploring the first ever coordinated experiments of km-scale climate models simulating a full annual cycle at horizontal grid spacings at km-scales (5 km or less) following a common protocol.\nThose participating in the Hackathon will be supported by regional nodes consisting of a common location for the hacking, an access to a combined data-compute resource hosting the data and proximate computing capbility for its analysis. Each node will host at least one full annual cycle of output data standardized on a common (HEALPix) grid. Standardizaiton will help participants share their analysis workflows to allow teams around the world to perform similar analyses across all the models hosted by the participating nodes, and thereby build global communities around common interests."

This could include output from km-scale regional models (ideally standardized similarly to the global models), or km-scale satellite data. Likewise computing capabilities could be augmented to support the application of machine learning."

All worked well and all have their pros and cons.\nconference hotel\n+ everything (meetings, accommodation, catering) at one location\n+ great sense of community as everyone is in one location\n+ a lot of organization is taken care of by the venue (rooms, technical equipment, catering)\n- usually more pricey\n- might be boked already\ncoworking space\n+ designed for these types of meetings with a lot of options for work in small groups\n+ venue organization and possibly catering can be taken care of by the venue\n- costs for the venue\nuniversity/research institutes\n+ usually free of charge or only a small fee\n+ can be easier to integrate “local” participants (as there is something happening just outside their offices)\n- considerably more work for local organizers (e.g. for catering, rooms, technical equipment)\n- availability usually depending on lecture periods\n\n\nRooms\n\none big(ger) lecture hall that fits all participants on Monday afternoon, Friday morning, and potential keynotes\na couple of smaller rooms for the groups to work in\n\nideally not more than 25 people in one room\nthis depends on the envisioned structure of the meetings; people on the same or similar topics should not be separated in different rooms\ntables and chairs should be movable (that was a little bit tricky in Madrid)\n\nor we could try out only one big room with everyone. could be noisy, could be good for collaboration\nextra room(s) for video recordings (depending on the plans)\nideally a smaller room (up to 5 people) for side meetings, people attending a video conference, etc.\nan area for coffee breaks, lunch (depends on the catering situation)\nideally flexible seating options outside the meeting rooms, so that people can move around a bit to work one-on-one or individually (could be just chairs on the corridor, in the cafeteria, some sofas somewhere, …)\na place where the simulation support team and the project management team can be during the week (doesn’t need to be a dedicated room, could also be in another room)\nquestion: how late can the rooms be accessed in the evenings?\n\n\n\nInfrastructure\nthis can usually be booked/organized later. Also, we can check and see what different IT department could provide if something is not available at the venue from the start.\n\nvideo streaming for opening and closing sessions (?), keynotes(?)\nstable wifi connection in all rooms; the traffic isn’t too much, since the data is processed at the computing centers, but the connections should be stable\nenough power outlets in the group rooms\n\n\n\nCatering\nthis can be adjusted depending on our budget\n\nusually two coffee breaks per full day\nand lunch\nin Berlin and Vienna, dinners were included, only one dinner was included in Madrid, Hamburg and Wageningen\npossibly an ice breaker event on the first evening\nsome snacks (fruits, etc.) and beverages to be accessible also outside of coffee breaks were very well received",
